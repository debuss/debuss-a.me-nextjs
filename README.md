This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).  
**The project was made using `yarn`.**

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

## Deploy on Vultr

The server is not powerful enough to clone the repository then install dependencies.  
Therefore we do everything locally, then we simply send everything to the server, where an nginx is configured.
